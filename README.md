# Curzon-Numbers
Curzon Number:
Given an integer N, check whether the given number is a Curzon Number or not. A number N is said to be a Curzon Number if 2N + 1 is divisible by 2*N + 1.

Program:
In this program, establish if a given integer num is a Curzon number. If 1 plus 2 elevated to num is exactly divisible by 1 plus 2 multiplied by num, then num is a Curzon number.  Given a non-negative integer num, implement a function that returns True if num is a Curzon number, or False otherwise.
